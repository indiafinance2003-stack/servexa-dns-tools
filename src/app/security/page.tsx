          Ravelyth is an open, community-maintained project. It holds no certifications and claims none; this page
          describes actual implemented controls.

            <strong>Password storage:</strong> passwords are hashed with Argon2id; plaintext passwords are never
            stored or logged.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sessions:</strong> cryptographically random session tokens in HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookies
            (Secure in production); only a SHA-256 hash of each token is stored server-side; sessions expire
            server-side after seven days.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Database access:</strong> all queries are parameterized through a typed query builder; queries
            run server-side only and credentials never reach the browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Input validation:</strong> server-side validation on every endpoint; oversized requests are
            rejected before processing.

          <li>
            <strong>Private network protection:</strong> domains and IP targets resolving to private, loopback, or
            link-local ranges are refused, so the tools cannot probe internal networks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rate limiting:</strong> per-client rolling limits on public endpoints, with stricter limits on
            login and registration.

          <li>
            <strong>Transport headers:</strong> Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options DENY, nosniff, and
            referrer restrictions are set on every response.

        <p>
          Being honest about what is not in place: rate limiting is in-memory (per application instance), so
          multi-instance deployments would need a shared store; there is no distributed DDoS protection beyond
          what the hosting network provides; and no email sending means no email-verified registration. These are
          documented limitations, not hidden weaknesses.
